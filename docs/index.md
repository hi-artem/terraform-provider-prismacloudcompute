# Prisma Cloud Compute provider
This is a community-driven fork of the official Prisma Cloud Compute provider with some extra sauce.

## Example Usage
```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    prismacloudcompute = {
      source  = "hi-artem/prismacloudcompute"
      version = "0.8.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "prismacloudcompute" {
  # Configure provider inline
  #
  console_url = "https://foo.bar.com"
  username = "myUsername"
  password = "myPassword"

  # Or you can use file
  #
  # config_file = "creds.json"
}
```

## Simplifying Policies
Resources representing policies can become really long. It is often helpful to simplify their structure using HCL `dynamic` blocks.

```hcl
# First define your hosts variable
variable "hosts" {
  default = [
    { 
      name: "ec2-development", 
      compliance_check: [
        { id: 16 }
      ]
    },
    { 
      name: "ec2-staging", 
      compliance_check: [
        { id: 16, block: true }
      ]
    },
    { 
      name: "ec2-production", 
      compliance_check: [
        { id: 16, block: true },
        { id: 18, block: false }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

# And then use dynamic blocks to create a rule for each host
resource "prismacloudcompute_host_compliance_policy" "ruleset" {
  dynamic "rule" {

    for_each = var.hosts
    content {
      name        = "${rule.value.name}-compliance-policy"
      notes       = "Compliance policy for ${rule.value.name} host"
      collections = rule.value.collection_name

      disabled           = false
      effect             = "alert"
      show_passed_checks = true
      verbose            = true

      dynamic "compliance_check" {
        for_each = rule.value.compliance_checks
        content {
          id    = compliance_check.value.id
          block = try(compliance_check.value.block, false)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
